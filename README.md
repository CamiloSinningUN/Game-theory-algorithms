# Game theory algorithms

This repository contains the implementation of some algorithms for game theory. 

## Algorithms

The algorithms are implemented using Python and AMPL. The algorithms are:

- **Nash Equilibrium**: The algorithm computes the Nash Equilibrium of a game.
    - **Best response regions**: This notebook shows in an interactive way the best response regions of a game.
    - **Lemke Howson**: This notebook shows the Lemke Howson algorithm to compute the Nash Equilibrium of a game and how it can vary by introducing a perturbation in the game.
    - ** Modified dresher procedure**: This notebook shows the modified dresher procedure for computing the proper zero Equilibria of a zero-sum game.
- **Stackelberg Equilibrium**: The algorithm computes the Stackelberg Equilibrium of a game. This folder contains the implementation of the Stackelberg Equilibrium algorithm in Normal Form and Sequence Form for a 2-player game. Additionally, it contains the implementation of a security game in the style of a sequence form game.
- **Ad auction with signaling**: This folder contains the implementation of the Ad auction with signaling algorithm and how different strategies can affect the outcome of the game.

## Credits

The implementation of the algorithms is based on the course Algorithmic Game Theory by Prof. Nicola Gatti at Politecnico di Milano.
